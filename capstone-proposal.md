### Name of Student: Marcus Kyung

### Name of Project: Capstone, Name TBD

### Project's Purpose or Goal: 
- Allow users to have a single source of truth for their health and fitness data.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- Allow users to create a daily entry logging their fitness and health data to include 
- Allow users to set a baseline for their fitness and health data as well as set goals for a list of set metrics
- Display a motivational quote (either randomly or on a set interval) from an API or list of quotes 

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

#### Frontend:
- React.js (CRA)
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap/React-Bootstrap
- Tailwind

#### Backend:
- MySQL/NoSQL Database (mongoDB, potentially)

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- Add a data visualization component to display the user's data in a more digestible format
- Wearable API integration (Oura, Whoop, AppleWatch, etc.)
- ChatGPT to offer suggestions to users based on previously logged exercises etc.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- Nivo.rocks (React data visualization library) or something similar
- API integration for wearable device
- OpenAI API 

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
- This project is intended to solve a real world problem. Currently much of the fitness and health data that I'd like to track is located in separate apps or devices. I have an Apple Watch for general exercise metrics and HR, an Oura ring for sleep, MyFitnessPal for tracking food, and a journal for recording weightlifting progression. I'd like to have a single place to store all of this data and be able to view it in a single dashboard. I'd also like to be able to export this data to a spreadsheet for further analysis. While recording everything in one location may offer fewer in depth functionalitites, i.e. losing the ability to track exact macronutrients via the MyFitnessPal app database, the trade off is worth it to be able to see holistic data from any particular day in one location.
