### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
- This project is intended to solve a real world problem. Currently much of the fitness and health data that I'd like to track is located in separate apps or devices. I have an Apple Watch for general exercise metrics and HR, an Oura ring for sleep, MyFitnessPal for tracking food, and a journal for recording weightlifting progression. I'd like to have a single place to store all of this data and be able to view it in a single dashboard. I'd also like to be able to export this data to a spreadsheet for further analysis. While recording everything in one location may offer fewer in depth functionalitites, i.e. losing the ability to track exact macronutrients via the MyFitnessPal app database, the trade off is worth it to be able to see holistic data from any particular day in one location.
